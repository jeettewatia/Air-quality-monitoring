OBJECTIVE:
The main objective of this project is to develop a IoT based Monitoring System which can actively monitor the quality of air by measuring the ppm of harmful gases present in the surroundings .
The data collected from sensors has to be uploaded  to the cloud for analysis.

Introduction
Air pollution has become a common phenomenon everywhere. Specially in the urban areas, air pollution is a real-life problem. In the urban areas, the increased number of petrol and diesel vehicles and the presence of industrial areas at the outskirts of the major cities are the main causes of air pollution. The problem is seriously intensified in the metropolitan cities. The governments all around the world are taking every measure in their capacity. Many European countries have aimed to replace petrol and diesel vehicles with the electric vehicles by 2030. Even India has aimed to do so by 2025.
The main aim of this project is to develop a device which can monitor PPM in air in real time, tell the quality of air and log data to a remote server(ThingSpeak).
The air monitoring device developed in this project is based on Arduino Uno. The Arduino board connects with ThingSpeak platform using ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. The sensor used for monitoring the air pollution is MQ-135 gas sensor. The sensor data is also displayed on a character LCD.
